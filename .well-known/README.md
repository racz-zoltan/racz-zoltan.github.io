# üìÅ .well-known/

This folder contains standard public metadata files used by security researchers, browsers, and automated tools to interact with **CarryPass** in a structured, privacy-aware way.

These files follow [IETF standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615) and are **publicly accessible** at:

- üîó [https://carrypass.net/.well-known/security.txt](https://carrypass.net/.well-known/security.txt)

> Note: If hosted via GitHub Pages, a `.nojekyll` file must exist in the project root to ensure `.well-known/` is correctly published.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

- `.well-known/` is intended for **automated tools**. Humans typically don‚Äôt visit it, but when they do via GitHub, this `README.md` helps clarify intent.
- Files placed here should be **plaintext and standardized** ‚Äî not JavaScript or app logic.
- You should avoid placing private files here.
