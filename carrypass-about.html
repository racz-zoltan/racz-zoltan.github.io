      <h2>Why I Created CarryPass</h2>
      <p>In 2020, one of my social media accounts was hacked, locking me out and exposing a hard truth: my password habits were terrible. I relied on the same base password across sites, occasionally adding a “1” or an exclamation mark to meet requirements. After the breach, I turned to a popular password manager — only to learn a few years later that it had also been compromised.
      That’s when I decided to build <strong>CarryPass</strong>: a stateless password manager and secure sharing tool that doesn't store or remember anything. There’s no cloud, no database, no sync service — just deterministic, client-side cryptography. Your passwords are never saved; they’re generated on demand, using pure math in your browser.
      CarryPass is my answer to insecure habits, data breaches, and trust-by-default tools. It’s privacy-first, server-free, and built for peace of mind.</p>

      <h2>Why CarryPass?</h2>
      <p>Most password managers rely on cloud sync, database storage, or browser extensions. CarryPass takes a different path: it never stores passwords at all. Instead, it <strong>calculates them on the fly</strong>, using a master password, service name, and your character type preferences.</p>
      <p>This means there's no sync to set up, no database to breach. You can regenerate the same secure password from any device — even offline.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>CarryPass uses a deterministic model combining <strong>Argon2id</strong>, <strong>PBKDF2</strong>, and <strong>AES-CTR</strong> to derive secure passwords. For shared credentials, it uses <strong>Argon2id</strong>, <strong>PBKDF2</strong>, and <strong>AES-GCM</strong> to encrypt vaults per user or team.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Passwords are derived — never stored</li>
        <li>Vaults are encrypted with per-user keys</li>
        <li>All encryption runs client-side in your browser</li>
        <li>No account, telemetry, or server ever involved</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>For Teams and Individuals</h2>

    <p>
      CarryPass supports secure credential sharing via <strong>team vaults</strong> and <strong>QR onboarding</strong>. Each team member can access only what they’ve been assigned — nothing more. <strong>TOTP verification</strong> is supported for extra protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Admins can prepare encrypted configs, assign members, and rotate credentials — all without accessing passwords themselves.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-6">
      <strong>CarryPass implements full end-to-end encryption (E2EE)</strong> for all sensitive data, including password vaults, credentials, and team configurations. All encryption and decryption operations are performed exclusively on the user's device, using keys derived locally from user-provided passcodes or credentials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Encrypted vaults may be stored locally or delivered via a server (including through service workers for offline use), but only in encrypted form. <strong>CarryPass servers and infrastructure never store or process plaintext data or encryption keys</strong>, and cannot access user vaults, passwords, or configurations at any time.
    </p>

    <p class="font-semibold text-green-700">
      This architecture ensures that only the intended recipient, using their local device and passcode, can access the decrypted content — even if encrypted data is intercepted, exfiltrated, or hosted on third-party infrastructure.
