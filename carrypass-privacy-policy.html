        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> The data you input in our Service, such as passwords and domain names, is processed entirely client-side, meaning it is handled exclusively in your browser.

            <li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect any usage data or employ statistical tools to track your activity within the Service.</li>
